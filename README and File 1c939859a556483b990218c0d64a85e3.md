## Repeat KNN for each k (from 1 to 20)

To calculate the average accuracy of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, repeat the KNN process for each value of k from 1 to 20. Perform this repetition at least five times and calculate the average accuracy as the final result. Please note that if you are using the latest version of scikit-learn, you need to program with Python>=3.5.

Make sure to use the same dataset, "iris data", for all iterations of the KNN algorithm.

## Line Chart

To visualize the accuracy of the KNN algorithm for different values of k, you can create a line chart. Use a "for loop" to iterate through the values of k from 1 to 20, and record the model accuracy for each iteration. Plot the results on the line chart.

If you observe that multiple values of k yield similar results, provide an explanation for this phenomenon.

## Quick Start

To run this code or Jupyter notebook, you'll need the following dependencies installed:

- `scipy`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install scipy pandas numpy

```
